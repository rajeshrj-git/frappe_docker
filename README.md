# ERPNext Jenkins Deployment Pipeline

## 1. Overview
This Jenkins pipeline automates the backup, deployment, and verification of an ERPNext environment running on Docker.
It ensures zero data loss by taking a MySQL/MariaDB database backup before deployment and includes an automatic rollback mechanism if deployment fails.

### Key Features
- Git checkout of ERPNext Docker repository
- Automatic Docker Compose file detection
- Pre-deployment checks (disk space, container status)
- Database backup with validation
- Docker container stop/build/start
- Post-deployment verification
- Optional rollback testing (non-production only)
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Backup retention management (keep last 7 backups)
- Deployment logging for audit purposes

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git installed on build server
- â‰¥1 GB free disk space

**Credentials:**

## 4. Setup Steps

1. **Prepare Jenkins Server:**
   - Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Git.
   - Add Jenkins user to Docker group and restart Jenkins:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
     sudo systemctl restart jenkins
     ```

2. **Prepare Backup Directory:**
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /path/to/backups
   sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /path/to/backups
